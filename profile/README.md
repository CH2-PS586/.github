Bangkit 2023 Batch 2

Product Capstone Project: FileManager.AI

## Introducing FileManager.AI

Executive Summary/Abstract:
Emerging technologies, particularly those related to artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly transforming various aspects of our lives, such as chatGPT where we can get a quick answer, GitHub Copilot where it helps developers to code, email generative and email summarization are now widely used by people. And yet there are still some aspects of our user experience that still haven't embraced machine learning capabilities, so we decided to start making them and we name it FileManager.AI.

In this AI era, we believe that we don’t really need to manage our own files and folders (directory). with the current AI technology we can create an automatic system where an AI manages our own files and folders automatically. With this technology we believe that it will increase user experience and business efficiency. The closest application that adopts this idea is Google Photos, where it associates photos with certain labels, but it is limited only to image files. This automatic file manager technology haven’t been adopted by File Manger (Windows), Google Drive or OneDrive.
